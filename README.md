    2. After you are logged in, go to https://www.strava.com/settings/api and create an app
    3. You should see the ‚ÄúMy API Application‚Äù page now. Keep it open and move on to the next step

3.  **Start the project.**

    Before starting up your project. Copy the .env.example into .env.development.local and replace the following variables with the ones from your newly created app page.

    `REACT_APP_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`

    `REACT_APP_STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`

    `REACT_APP_STRAVA_REDIRECT URI`

    ```sh
    yarn start
